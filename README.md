### USER MODEL
We are having problems with one of our functions. 
`getIdFromUsername(username)` in file `model/users-model.js` line 35. Should be returning an id number, but is returning an empty object. 
It works if you type directly into psql so not sure why this is happening. Because of this, route `/:user/books` isn't functioning. 

## Project Description
A REST API that returns JSON data. Our database holds data about the books that FAC cohort members have read.

## Technologies

### Set up with local deployment
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `$ npm install` on your terminal to install Node dependencies
3. Run these commands in your terminal to set up user, app database and test database
```
$ psql -c "CREATE USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword'"
$ psql -c "ALTER USER myuser WITH SUPERUSER"
$ psql -c "CREATE DATABASE readers_coders_db WITH OWNER myuser"
$ psql -c "CREATE DATABASE readers_coders_test_db WITH OWNER myuser"
```
5. Create a `.env` file in the root folder according to `.env-example`
6. Comment out the following line on your `connection.js` file which connects to the Heroku database
```
// connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
```
7. Run `psql` to enter Postgres CLI
8. Connect to database `# \c readers_coders_dbb`
9. Initialise database `# \i database/init.sql`
10. Run `$ npm run dev` to run app on localhost
11. Run `psql` and connect to test database `# \c readers_coders_test_db`
12. Run `$ npm test` to run tests

### Deployed virtually to Heroku
[Readers + Coders](https://readers-and-coders.herokuapp.com/books)
- Doesn't entirely work
- Have deployed with successful build
- Have successfully initialise Postgres database

## Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE users
(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255),
    cohort INTEGER
);
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE books
(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    author TEXT,
    fiction BOOLEAN
);
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_books
(
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    book_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, book_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
